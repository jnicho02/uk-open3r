Title: CODETHECITY ANNOUNCES SERVICE TO ENABLE UK LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO GENERATE OPEN3R WASTE STANDARD RESPONSES.

Subtitle: The Open3R standard enables Local Authorities to publish details of their waste processing facilities. This tool generates the responses for them.

Intro Paragraph: London, England - 28-Nov-2021 – Until now, there has been no common dictionary to describe what waste can be recycled and where. There should be opportunities for Councils and organisations to work together to improve the waste journey, but without basic information they cannot move on. This standard will open up the future of waste.

Customer Problems:
- The response for a machine-readable technical format like Open3R needs to be codified correctly. This requires some technical knowledge.
- Councils are already very busy and an extra requirement will take time to resolve
- Much of the information is already out there in some forms of open data

Solution: This tool automatically scans all of the Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs) in the United Kingdom that have been mapped on the Open Data OpenStreetMap. These data records link to Wikidata for further information. The tool then generates an Open3R response from the available data. The process runs automatically at a regular interval. All Councils have to do is keep publicly available OpenStreetMap and Wikidata up-to-date (with opening times, what waste is accepted, etc.) and they get the Open3R for 'free'.

Leader’s Quote: "Open data creates opportunities to turn rubbish into resources. This is an important first step in establishing an open data institution that can develop the necessary assets to enable waste data to become the valuable resource it should be." - Tom Passmore, Dsposal

Customer’s Job-to-be-Done: [Describe what a customer has to do to start using the product/service and how it works. Go into enough detail to give them confidence it actually solves the problem.]

Customer Quote: "Aldbourne Council are keen to support anything that keeps waste out of landfill, but we don't have the technical resources available to implement Open3R. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that Open Data advocates have solved the problem for us." - Alison Monroe, Leader of Aldbourne Council
